🌟 Vision
NERV is the first blockchain that simultaneously achieves:

Feature	Description	Status
Privacy by default	No addresses, balances, amounts, or metadata ever exposed on-chain	✅ Core design
Infinite horizontal scalability	>1 million sustained TPS with no theoretical upper bound via dynamic neural sharding	🔄 In development
Post-quantum security from genesis	Full NIST-standard lattice-based cryptography (Dilithium-3, ML-KEM-768)	✅ Spec complete
Endogenous intelligence	Nodes rewarded for useful-work federated learning that perpetually improves network encoders and predictors	🔄 

Research phase
We replace traditional Merkle trees with compact, homomorphic neural state embeddings (512-byte latent vectors from a transformer attested in hardware enclaves). Combined with 5-hop TEE-bound anonymous routing, AI-native optimistic consensus, and a pure useful-work economy, NERV becomes a self-improving, quantum-immune nervous system for private money and computation.

There is no foundation, no pre-mine, no VC allocation, no hidden treasuries. The launch is provably fair, and the protocol is fully open from day one.

🎯 Ethos & Principles
We are committed to:

<div align="center">
Principle	Commitment
🔒 Uncompromising Privacy	Privacy as the default, not an opt-in
📖 Radical Openness	Everything auditable, no hidden logic or allocations
⚖️ Provable Fairness	Zero pre-mine, transparent emissions, community governance from genesis
🛡️ Post-Quantum Readiness	No legacy curves in critical paths
💡 Useful Work Over Waste	Nodes earn by making the network smarter, not by burning energy
</div>
NERV belongs to the global privacy and open-source community. We invite cryptographers, systems engineers, privacy advocates, and builders to review, critique, audit, and contribute.

Let's build the nervous system of private money!
