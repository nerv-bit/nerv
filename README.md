NERV – The Private, Post-Quantum, Infinitely Scalable Blockchain
A living, self-improving financial nervous system built on neural state embeddings and useful-work

Open-source • No pre-mine • Community-governed • Fair launch June 2028

Vision
NERV is the first blockchain that simultaneously achieves:

✅ Privacy by default – No addresses, balances, amounts, or metadata ever exposed on-chain.
🚀 Infinite horizontal scalability – >1 million sustained TPS with no theoretical upper bound via dynamic neural sharding.
🛡️ Post-quantum security from genesis – Full NIST-standard lattice-based cryptography (Dilithium-3, ML-KEM-768).
🧠 Endogenous intelligence – Nodes are rewarded for useful-work federated learning that perpetually improves the network's own encoders and predictors.

We replace traditional Merkle trees with compact, homomorphic neural state embeddings (512-byte latent vectors from a transformer attested in hardware enclaves). Combined with 5-hop TEE-bound anonymous routing, AI-native optimistic consensus, and a pure useful-work economy, NERV becomes a self-improving, quantum-immune nervous system for private money and computation.

There is no foundation, no pre-mine, no VC allocation, no hidden treasuries. The launch is provably fair, and the protocol is fully open from day one.

📊 Current Repository Status
⚠️ Early-stage Development (December 2025)

This monorepo is in early-stage development:

✅ Core documentation (whitepaper, planning, testing)

🔄 No production node implementation yet – prototypes and circuits are under active development

All code, circuits, datasets, and specifications will be released under MIT/Apache 2.0 as they become available.

🎯 Ethos & Principles
We are committed to:

Uncompromising privacy as the default, not an opt-in

Radical openness – Everything auditable, no hidden logic or allocations

Provable fairness – Zero pre-mine, transparent emissions, community governance from genesis

Post-quantum readiness – No legacy curves in critical paths

Useful work over waste – Nodes earn by making the network smarter, not by burning energy or locking capital forever

NERV belongs to the global privacy and open-source community. We invite cryptographers, systems engineers, privacy advocates, and builders to review, critique, audit, and contribute.

Let's build the nervous system of private money!

🤝 Getting Involved
First Steps:
Read the whitepaper first – it contains the complete technical specification
