# **NERV** – The Private, Post-Quantum, Infinitely Scalable Blockchain

*A living, self-improving financial nervous system built on neural state embeddings and useful-work*

**Open-source • No pre-mine • Community-governed • Fair launch June 2028**

---

## Vision

NERV is the first blockchain that simultaneously achieves:

✅ **Privacy by default** – No addresses, balances, amounts, or metadata ever exposed on-chain.  
🚀 **Infinite horizontal scalability** – >1 million sustained TPS with no theoretical upper bound via dynamic neural sharding.  
🛡️ **Post-quantum security from genesis** – Full NIST-standard lattice-based cryptography (Dilithium-3, ML-KEM-768).  
🧠 **Endogenous intelligence** – Nodes are rewarded for useful-work federated learning that perpetually improves the network's own encoders and predictors.

We replace traditional Merkle trees with compact, homomorphic **neural state embeddings** (512-byte latent vectors from a transformer attested in hardware enclaves). Combined with 5-hop TEE-bound anonymous routing, AI-native optimistic consensus, and a pure useful-work economy, NERV becomes a self-improving, quantum-immune nervous system for private money and computation.

> **There is no foundation, no pre-mine, no VC allocation, no hidden treasuries. The launch is provably fair, and the protocol is fully open from day one.**

## 📊 Current Repository Status

**⚠️ Early-stage Development **

This monorepo is in early-stage development:

- ✅ Core documentation (whitepaper, planning, testing)
- ✅ Complete codebase 
- 🔄 No production node implementation yet – prototypes and circuits are under active development

**All code, circuits, datasets, and specifications will be released under MIT/Apache 2.0 as they become available.**

## 🎯 Ethos & Principles

We are committed to:

1. **Uncompromising privacy** as the default, not an opt-in
2. **Radical openness** – Everything auditable, no hidden logic or allocations
3. **Provable fairness** – Zero pre-mine, transparent emissions, community governance from genesis
4. **Post-quantum readiness** – No legacy curves in critical paths
5. **Useful work over waste** – Nodes earn by making the network smarter, not by burning energy or locking capital forever

NERV belongs to the global privacy and open-source community. We invite cryptographers, systems engineers, privacy advocates, and builders to review, critique, audit, and contribute.

> **Let's build the nervous system of private money!**
